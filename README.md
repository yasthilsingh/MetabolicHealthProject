# Physical Activity & Metabolic Health Analysis

This project explores how weekly physical-activity levels relate to metabolic markers—especially **fasting insulin**—using real NHANES data.  
Our goal is to uncover clear, reproducible links between movement and metabolic health.

## 📊 What This Project Does

* Converts raw NHANES activity surveys into **weekly minutes** of moderate & vigorous exercise  
* Cleans and standardizes biomarker variables (fasting glucose, insulin, HDL, etc.)  
* Detects and caps outliers using percentile thresholds  
* Visualizes the link between activity and insulin sensitivity  
* Compares metabolic markers between active and less-active groups

## Data Sources

This project uses data from the **2021 – 2022 cycle** of the  
[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html).

## 🧠 Why It Matters

* Quantifies *how much* movement improves fasting insulin  
* Highlights prevalence of physical inactivity in population samples  
* Guides evidence-based interventions for digital-health products, insurers, and clinicians

## 🔍 Key Visual Output

A custom four-panel dashboard shows:

* **Scatter & regression** – activity (x) vs. insulin (y)  
* **Box & violin** – activity and insulin distributions split by gender  
* **Jitter** – individual datapoints with goal thresholds highlighted

## 🧭 Next Steps

1. Extend to other biomarkers (cholesterol, HbA1c)  
2. Add demographic segmentation (age, ethnicity)  
3. Deploy as an interactive digital-health dashboard
