# Physical Activity & Metabolic Health Analysis

This project explores how weekly physical-activity levels relate to metabolic markers‚Äîespecially **fasting insulin**‚Äîusing real NHANES data.  
Our goal is to uncover clear, reproducible links between movement and metabolic health.

## üìä What This Project Does

* Converts raw NHANES activity surveys into **weekly minutes** of moderate & vigorous exercise  
* Cleans and standardizes biomarker variables (fasting glucose, insulin, HDL, etc.)  
* Detects and caps outliers using percentile thresholds  
* Visualizes the link between activity and insulin sensitivity  
* Compares metabolic markers between active and less-active groups

## Data Sources

This project relies exclusively on publicly available data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**, conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

| NHANES Cycle | Key Files Used<sup>‚Ä†</sup> | Download Page |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| 2011‚Äì2012 | `DEMO_G.xpt`, `GLU_G.xpt`, `PAQ_G.xpt` | https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?CycleBeginYear=2011 |
| 2013‚Äì2014 | `DEMO_H.xpt`, `GLU_H.xpt`, `PAQ_H.xpt` | https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?CycleBeginYear=2013 |
| 2015‚Äì2016 | `DEMO_I.xpt`, `GLU_I.xpt`, `PAQ_I.xpt` | https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?CycleBeginYear=2015 |
| 2017‚Äì2018 | `DEMO_J.xpt`, `GLU_J.xpt`, `PAQ_J.xpt` | https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?CycleBeginYear=2017 |

<sup>‚Ä†</sup>**Key files**  
- **DEMO\_** files provide demographic variables and sampling weights.  
- **GLU\_** files include fasting plasma glucose & insulin (used for surrogate markers of insulin sensitivity).  
- **PAQ\_** files contain physical-activity questionnaire data (weekly duration and intensity).  
Additional laboratory or examination files (e.g., lipids, CRP) are merged as needed.

All NHANES datasets are released under a public-domain‚Äìlike license; no special permission is required for academic or commercial use. For an overview of the program and its documentation see the main NHANES portal: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm>. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## üß† Why It Matters

* Quantifies *how much* movement improves fasting insulin  
* Highlights prevalence of physical inactivity in population samples  
* Guides evidence-based interventions for digital-health products, insurers, and clinicians

## üîç Key Visual Output

A custom four-panel dashboard shows:

* **Scatter & regression** ‚Äì activity (x) vs. insulin (y)  
* **Box & violin** ‚Äì activity and insulin distributions split by gender  
* **Jitter** ‚Äì individual datapoints with goal thresholds highlighted

## üß≠ Next Steps

1. Extend to other biomarkers (cholesterol, HbA1c)  
2. Add demographic segmentation (age, ethnicity)  
3. Deploy as an interactive digital-health dashboard  
4. Layer in economic datasets to estimate healthcare savings (see Market Analysisüëá)
